In this section, we develop a machine learning model on AWS, working with AWS S3 buckets and AWS Sagemaker. We tyhen demonstrate how to move data between various systems with a Postgres database containing Airbnb places to stay in Amsterdam. Once  a day we wioll download the latest data from the postgres database into our AWS S3 bucket. From there we will run a pandas job inside a docker container to determine the price fluctuations, and the result is saved back to S3.
